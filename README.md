# Running the react app

The react app lives in the client dir

```cd client``` 

If this is your first time running the app, install the project node modules:

```yarn```

To start the react app only:

```yarn start```

to start rails + minified production ready react app:

```yarn start:rails```

alternatively, you can run the above command via shell script

from the project root:

```sh start.sh```
